"""Read-model projections (DESIGN §6.1/§6.2): disposable caches derived from
events. NEVER writes the events table — rebuild derives FROM it only.

P0 projections: ``runs`` (one row per RunStarted, D15 experiment registry)
and ``config_versions`` (from ConfigChanged). The rest of the §6.2 read-model
list lands with its producing subsystems.

SPRINT P2 batch A adds four more projection tables' DDL (`theses`,
`pnl_daily`, `series`, `promotion_state`) per §6.2's read-model list and the
sprint addendum's "these are PROJECTIONS in _projections.py; extend
test_rebuild.py idempotence to all four" pin. Consumers here read the DICT
event envelope, never the typed producer-side payload models in
``contracts._event_payloads`` (ASSUMPTIONS 10's ratified split — see that
module's docstring).

Batch-A scope: the DDL for all four tables is real (so `rebuild()`/
`ensure_tables()` are green infrastructure from birth, same as `runs`/
`config_versions`). `ThesisDrafted` gets minimal handling (inserts a
`state="draft"` row) — the pre-existing P0 done-gate replay test
(`tests/replay/test_p0_replay.py`) already appends a bare `ThesisDrafted`
event and calls `rebuild()`; that baseline test stays green. Every
STATE-TRANSITION past `draft` (`ThesisSubmitted` -> `ThesisApproved`/
`ThesisRejected`/`ThesisActivated`) is now implemented (SPRINT P2 batch A dev
pass) by UPDATEing the existing `theses` row for the event's `thesis_id` —
`ThesisGraded`'s outcome/pnl population lands with grade() in batch B.
`pnl_daily` (FillRecorded net-of-fees aggregation) and `series`/
`promotion_state` (batch D semantics) get NO `_apply` handling at all this
batch — an unhandled event type is silently skipped by `_apply`, same as the
existing `LessonRecorded`-is-noise pattern, so those three tables stay empty
and inert (which is exactly what "empty-ledger rebuild is a no-op" and
"tables exist after rebuild" require, with no red test attached to them
yet).
