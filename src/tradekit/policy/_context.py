"""Frozen policy-context snapshot (DESIGN §7.1; CTO addendum, story-3 pins).

`PolicyContext` (the SHAPE) is REAL this batch — `_rules.py`'s `check`
callables are typed against it and the per-rule allow/deny tests construct
synthetic instances directly, exactly the same "declarative data the tests
read" status as `_dials.PolicyDials`/`_rules.RULES` (CTO's batch-C red/green
split call). `assemble()` (the I/O-performing PROJECTIONS -> PolicyContext
reader) stays an unconditional `NotImplementedError` stub this batch — it is
one of the six-verbs-adjacent pieces the CTO pinned red (batch D's series/
promotion projections don't exist yet for it to read from anyway).

Anti-permissive default rule (CTO addendum, story-3 pins): "a rule must
never pass because data was missing." Every `PolicyContext` field a rule
NEEDS to render a real verdict is `| None`-typed with NO non-None default —
`assemble()` (once implemented) must set it explicitly from a projection, or
leave it `None`, and `_rules.py`'s per-rule `check` treats `None` on a
needed field as `insufficient_context` (deny), never a silent pass. Fields
that are legitimately EMPTY in P2 (no open positions yet, since P2 ships no
broker fill pipeline) default to their empty container (`{}`/`[]`/`0`) —
those are vacuous passes, not missing data; see `tests/ASSUMPTIONS.md`'s
batch-C entry enumerating the split per rule.
