# Test-suite assumptions pending CTO ratification

Where DESIGN.md leaves a contract detail open, the tests pin the minimal obvious shape below. Ratify or correct each line BEFORE implementation; changing one later means changing the tests in the same commit.

1. `quantize` rounds exact midpoints with **ROUND_HALF_EVEN** (banker's rounding) — pinned in `test_quantize.py::test_midpoint_rounding_pinned_half_even`.
2. `quantize` accepts both `float` and `Decimal` input and returns a `Decimal` carrying the tick's exponent (e.g. scale -2 for tick 0.01).
3. `Predicate` and `InvalidationSpec` validate as discriminated unions on a `kind` field; tests construct them from dicts via `pydantic.TypeAdapter`, so either a union type-alias export or a base-model export satisfies the suite.
4. `InvalidationSpec` kinds are `"measurable"` (field `predicate: Predicate`) and `"structural"` (fields `description: str` nonempty, `requires_attestation: bool` defaulting/forced to `True`).
5. Predicate variants reject undeclared fields (`extra="forbid"` or equivalent) — that is how `time_expiry` rejects `cmp`/`value` being set.
6. `AssetRef` fields: `symbol`, `venue`, `asset_class`, `tick_size` (Decimal).
7. `EntrySpec` fields: `order_type`, `limit_price`, `valid_until` (per §5.1 "order_type, limit/trigger price, valid_until").
8. `EVBlock` fields: `p_win`, `reward_usd`, `risk_usd`, `ev_usd`; the `*_usd` fields are `Decimal` (p_win's exact numeric type is unpinned, but it must be numeric — prose rejects).
9. `Event` envelope field names: `event_id`, `ts_utc`, `type`, `actor`, `run_id` (optional/None allowed), `schema_ver`, `payload`; matches the §6.2 column list.
10. The `Event` envelope accepts a plain JSON-object `dict` as `payload`; per-type typed payload models are a producer-side concern, not enforced at the envelope. (If the envelope DOES validate payloads per type, the fixture payloads in `conftest.py` must be updated to match the typed models.)
11. `Event.type` is validated against the §6.3 v1 taxonomy at the envelope — an unknown type is a `ValidationError`.
12. `EventFilter` minimal shape: `types: list[str] | None`, `since: datetime | None`, `until: datetime | None`, all defaulting to None; `EventFilter()` (empty) matches everything. Boundary inclusivity of since/until is deliberately NOT pinned (test timestamps avoid the boundaries).
13. `ChainReport` minimal shape: `ok: bool`, `first_bad_seq: int | None` (None when ok).
14. `Ledger.append` returns the event_id of the persisted row; tests use the returned value rather than assuming the caller-supplied `event_id` is kept verbatim.
15. TK_RUN_ID stamping happens at append time and only fills a missing `run_id`; an explicit `run_id` on the event always wins.
16. Read-model projections live as SQLite tables inside `ledger.db`; the runs projection is a table named `runs` with one row per `RunStarted` event. Tests observe/corrupt projections via raw `sqlite3` as a harness action (never importing ledger internals).
17. `Ledger.search` returns a list of `Event` models and returns `[]` (never raises) on no match.
18. `ts_utc` on the `Event` model is a timezone-aware UTC `datetime` (serialized ISO-8601 in the DB per §6.2).
19. Two `Ledger` instances open on the same file concurrently is a supported, non-erroring topology (TD-16 WAL + busy_timeout); the suite smoke-tests interleaved appends from two handles.

## CTO ratification — 2026-07-12

All 19 assumptions **ratified** as written, with one scope note:

- (10) Ratified for P0: the envelope accepts plain-dict payloads with taxonomy
  validation on `type`. Typed per-event payload models land WITH their producing
  subsystems (P2/P3) — designing ~28 payload shapes before those subsystems
  exist would be designing against vapor. ROADMAP M0.2 updated to match.
- (1) ROUND_HALF_EVEN confirmed — banker's rounding is the financial standard.
- (12) since/until boundary inclusivity: implementation should treat both as
  INCLUSIVE and document it; tests deliberately avoid the boundary so this is
  not load-bearing yet.

Changing any ratified line later requires updating tests + this file in the
same commit (DESIGN maintenance rule applies here too).
